# Design Patterns Before and After Examples

This repository contains Java source code examples demonstrating how applying design patterns can improve code quality, most especially, how we can use design patterns to eliminate redundant decisions.

For each design pattern, you will find:
- **Before**: Code without using the pattern, containing redundant decisions.
- **After**: Refactored code applying the design pattern, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable solutions, and no redundant decisions.

The covered design patterns are:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Builder
- Decorator

The goal of this repository is to support researchers working in the field of design patterns and refactoring by providing clear before-and-after examples.

These examples are also valuable for testing and teaching automatic refactoring tools.
