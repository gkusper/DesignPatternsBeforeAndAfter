# Adapter Before and After Example

This folder contains Java source code examples that demonstrate how the Adapter design pattern can improve code quality.

- **Before**: The `AdapterClient` class handles two versions of an adaptee with redundant `if` statements.
- **After**: The `AdapterClient` class uses the Adapter design pattern to eliminate redundancy by introducing polymorphic method calls.

Both versions implement the same behavior, but the "after" version is cleaner and follows better design principles.

These examples support research on refactoring techniques and demonstrate how applying design patterns can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.
